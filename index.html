          Abramović was born November 30, 1946 and raised in Belgrade,
          Yugoslavia (now Serbia).
          <br />
          <br />
          In 1965 she enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Belgrade to study
          painting. Eventually she became interested in the possibilities of
          performance art, specifically the ability to use her body for artistic
          and spiritual exploration.
          <br />
          <br />
          In 1972, she conceived a series of visceral performance pieces that
          engaged her body as both subject and medium.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            In Rhythm 10 (1973), for instance, she methodically stabbed the
            spaces between her fingers with a knife, at times drawing blood.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            In Rhythm 0 (1974) she stood immobile in a room for six hours along
            with 72 objects, ranging from a rose to a loaded gun, that the
            audience was invited to use on her however they wished.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p class="jebeni-paragraf">
          These pieces provoked controversy for their perilousness and for
          Abramović’s occasional nudity, which would become a regular element of
          her work thereafter.

          In 1975 Abramović moved to Amsterdam, and a year later she began
          collaborating with <strong>Uwe Laysiepen (Ulay),</strong> a
          like-minded German artist. Much of their work together was concerned
          with gender identity, most notoriously Imponderabilia (1977), in which
          they stood naked while facing each other in a museum’s narrow
          entrance, forcing visitors to squeeze between them and, in so doing,
          to choose which of the two to face.

          The couple also traveled and performed extensively around the world.
          They broke up in 1988 at the conclusion of a performance in which they
          started at opposite ends of the Great Wall of China and met in the
          middle.

          Abramović’s profile was raised in 1997, when she won the Golden Lion
          for best artist at the Venice Biennale. Her exhibit, the brooding
          Balkan Baroque, used both video and live performance to interrogate
          her cultural and familial identity.

          By 2005 she had begun to ruminate on the legacy of performance art, a
          genre in which individual works usually had no life beyond their
          original staging, apart from their occasional preservation on film.

          That year, in an attempt to counteract that tradition, Abramović
          presented Seven Easy Pieces, a series of reenactments, or
          “reperformances,” of seminal works—two of her own and five by other
          performance artists, including Bruce Nauman and Joseph Beuys—at the
          Guggenheim Museum in New York City.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2010 the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City held a
          wide-ranging retrospective of Abramović’s work, The Artist Is Present.
          For the exhibition, Abramović debuted the eponymous performance piece,
          in which she sat quietly as museum patrons took turns sitting opposite
          and looking at her as she gazed back.
          <br />
          <br />
          Piece brought Abramović further recognition—as did the 2012 HBO
          documentary The Artist Is Present. A chronicle of the retrospective,
          it also documented Abramović’s test of physical endurance as she sats
          motionless for seven hours each day during the three-month-long
          exhibition run.

        <br />

        <p>
          After the MoMA retrospective, Abramović became a celebrity, continuing
          to explore and teach performance art bthrough workshops at art
          galleries and her organizationsthe Marina Abramović Institute. In 2016
          Abramović published the memoir Walk Through Walls.

        He said: "Do you ever know what the birds are singing?"

        You don't. But still listen to them anyway.

        So, sometimes with art, it is important just to look."
