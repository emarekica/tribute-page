        performance artist known for works that dramatically tested the

    <div id="main">
      <p>
        Abramović was born November 30, 1946 and raised in Belgrade, Yugoslavia
        (now Serbia).
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1965 she enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Belgrade to study
        painting. Eventually, however, she became interested in the
        possibilities of performance art, specifically the ability to use her
        body as a site of artistic and spiritual exploration.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1972, Abramović conceived a series of visceral performance pieces
        that engaged her body as both subject and medium. In Rhythm 10 (1973),
        for instance, she methodically stabbed the spaces between her fingers
        with a knife, at times drawing blood. In Rhythm 0 (1974) she stood
        immobile in a room for six hours along with 72 objects, ranging from a
        rose to a loaded gun, that the audience was invited to use on her
        however they wished.
      </p>
      <br />

        <p class="img-caption">Rythm 0 performance</p>

      <p>
        These pieces provoked controversy not only for their perilousness but
        also for Abramović’s occasional nudity, which would become a regular
        element of her work thereafter.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1975 Abramović moved to Amsterdam, and a year later she began
        collaborating with <strong>Uwe Laysiepen (byname Ulay),</strong> a
        like-minded German artist. Much of their work together was concerned
        with gender identity, most notoriously Imponderabilia (1977), in which
        they stood naked while facing each other in a museum’s narrow entrance,
        forcing visitors to squeeze between them and, in so doing, to choose
        which of the two to face.
      </p>

      <p>
        Abramović’s profile was raised in 1997, when she won the Golden Lion for
        best artist at the Venice Biennale. Her exhibit, the brooding Balkan
        Baroque, used both video and live performance to interrogate her
        cultural and familial identity.

        She also captured public attention for The House with the Ocean View
        (2002), a gallery installation in which she lived ascetically for 12
        days in three exposed cubes mounted onto a wall. By 2005 she had begun
        to ruminate on the legacy of performance art, a genre in which
        individual works usually had no life beyond their original staging,
        apart from their occasional preservation on film. That year, in an
        attempt to counteract that tradition, Abramović presented Seven Easy
        Pieces, a series of reenactments, or “reperformances,” of seminal
        works—two of her own and five by other performance artists, including
        Bruce Nauman and Joseph Beuys—at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        In 2010 the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City held a
        wide-ranging retrospective of Abramović’s work, The Artist Is Present.
      </p>
      <br />

      <div class="img-container">
        <img
          src="img/artist-is-present.jpeg"
          alt="Artist is present performance photo"
        />
        <p class="img-caption">Artist is present</p>
      </div>
      <br />

      <p>
        For the exhibition, Abramović debuted the eponymous performance piece,
        in which she sat quietly as museum patrons took turns sitting opposite
        and looking at her as she gazed back. The chance to participate in the
        work helped attract long lines of visitors. The retrospective also
        featured a company of performers reenacting Abramović’s earlier work.
        Although the reperformances were often criticized for eradicating the
        energy and unpredictability of the original presentations, they and the
        new performance piece brought Abramović further recognition—as did the
        2012 HBO documentary The Artist Is Present. A chronicle of the
        retrospective, it also documented Abramović’s test of physical endurance
        as she sat motionless for seven hours each day during the
        three-month-long exhibition run.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        After the MoMA retrospective, Abramović became something of a celebrity,
        collaborating with such pop icons as Jay Z, Lady Gaga, and James Franco.
        She continued to explore the legacy of performance art by teaching her
        principles through workshops at art galleries and later through her
        organizations, most notably the Marina Abramović Institute in New York
        state. In 2016 Abramović published the memoir Walk Through Walls.

          "Once, Picasso was asked what his paintings meant. He said: "Do you
          ever know what the birds are singing?"
          <br />
          You don't. But still listen to them anyway.
          <br />
          So, sometimes with art, it is important just to look."
